First of all, we should know what AngularJS is? AngularJS is a javascript framework for building client side applications. When i say client side application then i mean by the fucntionality of an application without making a call to server. The best example is Gmail. Once we log in the gmail application, if we create a new email then that will not send a request to server but its all handled on client side. 

Before we actually being with understanding angularJS framework lets just brushup the basics about how a client server application works with focusing especially on front end technologies like HTML, CSS and javascript. HTML is language which creates a web page like what to be displayed. When server send the HTML content its more like the text sent to the client (browser). Then, client parse the html and creates the dom. Dom is a tree of html elements. CSS is used to override the default CSS of the browser. THink this way, if just HTML is sent without any styling then the rendering browser will have some styling standard like white background, black text, font size or font type. With CSS, we can override this default styling. CSS defined how to present the document. Javascript is a dymanic language. JS response could be different for same code thus its called as dynamic. JS used HTML DOM to access HTML elements and modify them. With JS, we can cover a lot of features in an application in absence of which we had to send the request. One simple example is validation. If we cant do validation using JS at client side then we had to send data to server for validation and thn processing.
