We have HTML5Combo file which has w3scool tutorial as well as the interview question. However, We cannot really make much from it. Thus, we are covering only top 5 features of HTML5. 

HTML5 top 5 Features - 
1. Multimedia support in HTML5: Before HTML5 we can embed a video in a web page through a plugin. HTML5 introduces a new element <video> element to give a HTML way of embedding a video to your web page. 
<video width="400" controls>
	<source src="video1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	<source src="video2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Text if you video does not loads comes here
</video>
controls attribute gives the controls like play, pause and other. while we can have another attribute called autoplay for playing the vdeo on the page load and controls to play and pause will not appear. 

2. HTML5 has given many new cool values for element type attributes. Before HTML5 we has input elements type attribute values which are text, password, radio, submit, button, checkbox, reset and may be a few other. Now, lets see what new value have we got. These are below mentioned:
1. email: Input for entering email. Will give you suggestion of the cached email id you recently typed. 
2. date: Input for selecting date from the calendar that will open after you click. We have input specifically for week, month or year.
3. url: Input for entering a url. It gives to default support of validation.
4. color: Input for selecting color.
Note: For certain type it gives basic validation too like for email and url. 

3. HTML5 canvas
This is more related to graphics. HTML5 introduces <canvas> tag which can be used through javascript and its object has many API and properties. Below is the code example:
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100" style="border:1px solid #d3d3d3;">
Your browser does not support the HTML5 canvas tag.</canvas>

<script>
var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
ctx.font = "30px Arial";
ctx.strokeText("Hello World",10,50);
</script>

4. Content Editable atribute
This is so far my fevorite feature of HTML5. HTML 5 has introduced an attribute which is contenteditable helps to create editable paragraphs. Below is the code:
<p contenteditable="true">This is a paragraph. It is editable. Try to change this text.</p>

5. HTML5 Web Storage
Before HTML5, cookies were generally the best way to store the application data that help track the preferences and characteristics of the user. With HTML5, we have got the concept of web storage which is more secured and can store way more data the cookies (5MB). We have two object in window object which are localstorage and sessionStorage. LocalStorage does not has any expiry while sessionStorage data gets expired right after the browser is closed. We can use these object's getItem and setItem api for setting and getting the data in it liek below:
// Store
localStorage.setItem("lastname", "Smith");
// Retrieve
document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = localStorage.getItem("lastname"); 
Other way of doing the same could be:

Note: 
1. HTML5 is backword compatible.
2. Difference in Cookies and Cache: Although cookie and cache stores data of the web page server different purposes. Cookie is used to store data to track the characterstics related to the user while Cache is used to store data so that the same page gets loaded earlier next time the user opens. Cookies are used to store preferences of the user while cache is used to store the files like text, audio or video etc. Cookies get deleted after some specified time while cache gets stored in the client machine until user does not delete in manually.
